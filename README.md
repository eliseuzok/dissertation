Overview
This repository accompanies a project focused on identifying **homozygous deletions** in **single-cell DNA sequencing** (scDNA-seq) datasets, with a particular emphasis on breast cancer and osteosarcoma samples. It includes tools to simulate cancer genomes with deletions, develop an algorithm for detection, and apply this algorithm to real datasets.

ðŸ“Œ Project Aims
-Develop a computational method to accurately identify homozygous deletions in scDNA-seq cancer genomes.

-Apply this method to large scDNA-seq datasets to study the frequency and genomic distribution of homozygous deletions.

-Investigate whether tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) are enriched at these deletion sites.

ðŸ”¬ Methodological Pipeline
1. In-Silico Simulation
Reference Genome (GRCh38): Downloaded and processed to exclude non-canonical chromosomes.

Normal Cell Creation: Simulated diploid genome generated with SNVs (using Mutation Simulator).

Tumour Cell Creation: Chromosome-wide deletions introduced (e.g., Chr2 for homozygous deletion, Chr17 for heterozygous).

Read Simulation: Paired-end sequencing simulated using ArtIllumina and aligned using BWA + Samtools.

Bin Counting: Reads binned at 5Mb, 500kb, and 50kb with Bedtools; RDRs calculated.

Threshold Derivation: Descriptive statistics used to define RDR thresholds indicative of homozygous deletions.

2. Dataset Analysis
Datasets: 6 scDNA-seq datasets (3 breast cancer [3 patients], 3 osteosarcoma [single patient]) processed via CHISEL, covering >17,000 cells.

Clustering & Visualization: Subclones and deletion patterns explored using clustering heatmaps, RDR profiles, and frequency plots.

TSG Enrichment: Deletion hotspots cross-referenced with TSGs using the COSMIC database.
